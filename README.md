# GPT-CodeCraft: AI-Driven Python Code Refactoring Tool

## Project Introduction and Purpose

GPT-CodeCraft is a Python script that leverages GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology to refactor and improve existing Python code. The script analyzes Python code files, identifies areas for enhancement, and generates refactored code snippets. This tool aims to assist developers in improving their Python code by providing AI-generated code refactoring suggestions and enhancements. It offers a valuable tool for enhancing code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set your OpenAI API key in the `gpt_integration.py` file.

## Usage Guide with Examples

To use GPT-CodeCraft, run the `main.py` script with the Python file you want to refactor as an argument. For example:

```bash
python main.py your_file.py
```

The script will analyze the code, generate refactoring suggestions, detect errors, apply the refactoring and error corrections, and then print the refactored code.

## Supported Code Refactoring Categories

GPT-CodeCraft supports the following code refactoring categories:

- Code simplification
- Variable naming enhancement
- Optimization for performance and readability

## Customization Options

You can customize the behavior of GPT-CodeCraft by modifying the parameters in the `gpt_integration.py`, `code_analysis.py`, `refactoring_suggestions.py`, and `error_detection.py` files.

## How GPT-CodeCraft Works

GPT-CodeCraft works by analyzing the structure, readability, and adherence to best practices of the given Python code file. It then generates refactoring suggestions and detects errors in the code. These suggestions and errors are passed to the GPT model, which generates a refactored code snippet. The refactored code is then validated and provided to the user.

## Acknowledgments and Credits

This project uses the OpenAI GPT API for natural language processing and code refactoring.

## Contribution Guidelines

If you would like to contribute to this project, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes.

## License Information

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more details.

## Security Measures

GPT-CodeCraft implements security measures to protect user data and ensure the secure handling of code files. Before processing, the script checks the security of the file.

## Error Handling

GPT-CodeCraft includes error-handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected issues during code analysis and refactoring. If an error occurs, the script will catch the exception and handle it appropriately.

## Documentation and Comments

The code for GPT-CodeCraft is well-structured and well-documented. Each function includes a docstring that explains what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.

## Continuous Improvement

We plan to make ongoing improvements and updates to enhance GPT-CodeCraft's capabilities and code refactoring suggestions. User feedback is encouraged and will be used to guide these improvements.

## User Feedback

After using GPT-CodeCraft, users are encouraged to provide feedback on the quality and usefulness of the AI-generated code refactoring suggestions. This feedback can be submitted by running the `user_feedback.py` script.
